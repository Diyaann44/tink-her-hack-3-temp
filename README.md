### Project Description
RDL Maps is a technology-driven solution designed to assist individuals in navigating through the campus of GEC Thrissur. With this project, users will be able to easily locate buildings, classrooms, and points of interest on campus. We aim to provide an interactive and user-friendly map experience through our website.

### The Problem Statement
Students and visitors often struggle to navigate large campuses, and finding specific buildings or classrooms can be difficult. RDL Maps seeks to resolve this by providing an efficient way to explore the campus and find important locations with ease.

### The Solution
We are solving this problem by creating a campus map website using HTML and integrating the **HERE Maps API** for real-time navigation and location finding. Users can input destinations and get real-time directions and locations of interest.
